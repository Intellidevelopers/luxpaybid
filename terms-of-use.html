<h3 class="heading_text2 pt2 pb2">BIDDING AND PURCHASING</h3>
<p class="subtext">In order to bid on products offered for auction on the Site, you will be required to purchase “BidPacks.” You may purchase BidPacks by making payment via any of the payment options available on the Site. All BidPack purchases are final and non-refundable.</p>
<p class="subtext">By clicking the “Bid Now” button, you have made a binding offer to purchase the item listed. Your offer cannot be rescinded and will be deemed accepted if your bid is the winning bid. You agree to have one Bid (or, where indicated on Big-Ticket items, two or more Bids) deducted from your account each time you click the “Bid Now” button or use our “BidMate” tool. BY PARTICIPATING IN AN AUCTION, YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT ANY BIDS DEDUCTED FROM YOUR ACCOUNT ARE NON-REFUNDABLE.</p>
<p class="subtext">If you are unsuccessful in an auction, you may opt to buy the item if it is eligible for purchase. If you choose to purchase any eligible item, you agree to pay the full purchase price. By clicking the “Buy It Now” button, you have made a binding offer to purchase the item listed. Your offer to purchase the item becomes final after you authorise payment on the Site. Any dissatisfaction with the purchased item will be subject to our <a href="orders-and-shipping.html#exchange">Exchange and Refunds</a> Policy.</p>
<p class="subtext"><strong>Payments. </strong>When redeeming any item won in an auction; or when purchasing BidPacks or items listed for sale on the Site, you may be asked to supply certain information relevant to your transaction, including without limitation, the name on the card, your credit or debit card number, the expiration date of your credit or debit card, your billing address, your PIN, your Bank Verification Number (BVN) and your shipping information. YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU HAVE THE LEGAL RIGHT TO USE ANY CREDIT OR DEBIT CARD(S) UTILISED IN CONNECTION WITH ANY TRANSACTION. By submitting such information, you grant the third party collecting that information on behalf of Kobobid the right to provide such information to third parties for purposes of facilitating the completion of transactions initiated by you or on your behalf. Verification of information may be required prior to the acknowledgment or completion of any transaction. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOU ARE CHARGED AT THE TIME YOU PLACE YOUR ORDER FOR ITEMS. YOU FURTHER UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT THE TRANSACTION FOR THE PURCHASE IS FINAL AND COMPLETE AT THE TIME YOUR ACCOUNT IS CHARGED AND IS NON-REFUNDABLE. You agree to pay all charges incurred by you, on your behalf, or by your account(s) through the Site, at the price in effect when such charges are incurred. You are solely responsible for any taxes applicable to your transaction.</p>
<p class="subtext">This Site does not process credit or debit cards, or take other payment processing information. Payment processing is handled through third-party services. Our current third-party processors are Flutterwave and Pagatech. Flutterwave’s Terms of Use and Privacy Policy may be found <a href="https://flutterwave.com/ng/terms" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="https://flutterwave.com/ng/privacy-policy" target="_blank">here</a>. For Pagatech, you may find their Terms of Service, <a href="https://www.mypaga.com/paga-web/customer/static/company/terms" target="_blank">here</a> and Privacy Policy, <a href="https://www.mypaga.com/paga-web/customer/static/company/privacy" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p class="subtext">If, for any reason, your bank declines or otherwise refuses to pay the amount owed for the items you have purchased, you agree that We may, at our option, suspend or terminate delivery of products and may require you to pay any overdue amounts incurred (including any third-party chargeback fees or penalties) by other means acceptable to Us. In the event legal action is necessary to collect on balances due, you agree to reimburse Us for all expenses incurred to recover sums due, including attorney fees and other legal expenses.</p>
<p class="subtext"><strong>Real Bids and Token Bids.</strong> ​Real Bids are bids that are purchased at the regular or discounted cost price displayed on the Site. Real Bids are valid for an initial period of 60 days from date of purchase after which they are converted to Token Bids. Converted Token Bids expire after 365 days.</p>
<p class="subtext">Token Bids are bids that you won, earned or received by engaging in certain activities on the Site or via promotions. Token Bids that are won, earned or received expire after 60 days of receiving them</p>
<p class="subtext"><strong>Bids Transfer. </strong>You may use the “Bids Transfer” feature to send bids to your family and friends who have accounts with Us. You can only send Real Bids with the Bids Transfer feature; Token Bids cannot be sent. The conversion from Real Bids to Token Bids as well as the expiration date of the bids you receive will be based on the date of original purchase.</p>
<p class="subtext"><strong>Option to Purchase.</strong> Products that have the “Buy It Now” feature are available for auction and/or outright purchase on the Site. If you do not win the bid on a product that has the “Buy It Now” feature, you may choose to apply your used bids towards the purchase of that product within 24 hours from the end of that auction. Only Real Bids that have already been used in an auction can be applied towards a purchase and the used Real Bids can only be applied towards the purchase of the same product that resulted in a lost auction. </p>
<p class="subtext"><strong>BidMate.</strong> You may use our automated bidding tool called ‘BidMate’. BidMate is a tool that assists you in bidding in your auction of choice while You are online or offline. You may activate or deactivate BidMate at any time, and multiple BidMates may simultaneously be activated across various ongoing auctions on the Site. Real Bids and Token Bids can be used by the BidMate tool and your Bids will be used in the order in which they were bought, from the oldest to the newest. Note that if the item you’re bidding on only allows Real Bids, your BidMate will follow suit. Once activated, BidMate will be able to use up to 30 bids to bid on your behalf and will bid according to the specifications which you have set.
</p>
<p class="subtext">Activating BidMate does not guarantee participation in an auction and We do not guarantee the precision or effectiveness of the BidMate tool. Kobobid will therefore not be liable for any errors or delays that occur while using the BidMate tool.</p>
<p class="subtext"><strong>Big-Ticket Items.</strong> ​Big-Ticket items are the most expensive items of the day or week which are valued at N100, 000 (One Hundred Thousand Naira) or more. Only Real Bids may be used to bid on Big-Ticket items.</p>
<p class="subtext"><strong>Limit Crusher.</strong> ​Limit Crusher is a special type of token that enables winners who have existing Auction Limits to override their limitations. Limit Crusher may be obtained by purchasing a Limit Crusher, purchasing Premium BidPacks, receiving it as a bonus, or it may be won in an auction, promotion or other activity on the Site.</p>
<p class="subtext"><strong>No New Bidder Limit.</strong> ​Prior to going live, certain auctions will be labelled with a “No New Bidders” tag at a specific Naira Amount. Once the auction item reaches the Naira amount limit, it becomes a “closed” auction and availability will be limited to bidders that already placed bids in that auction prior to the restricted Naira limit amount.</p>
<p class="subtext"><strong>Additional Terms and Conditions.</strong> Certain auctions may contain Additional Terms and Conditions in the product description. You understand and agree that if you are the winner of any auction that contains any Additional Terms and Conditions, you shall be bound by the provisions of these Terms and the Additional Terms and Conditions.</p>
<h3 class="heading_text2 pt2 pb2">REDEEMING A SUCCESSFUL BID</h3>
<p class="subtext">If you are successful in an auction, you will be required to pay the Final Auction Price, plus the listed shipping and handling charges within 48 hours of the close of the auction. This payment is required in order to redeem the item won and a failure or refusal to make the payment within the 48-hour timeframe will be considered a forfeiture of the auction win. Once a forfeiture occurs, the next runner-up bidder will be offered the item. The runner-up bidder will also have 48 hours from the time of notification within which to pay the Final Bid Purchase Price and the associated shipping and handling charges, in order to redeem the item. Each subsequent runner-up bidder will be offered the item in turn, until a bidder redeems it. If no bidder redeems the item, the item may be offered up again for auction.</p>
